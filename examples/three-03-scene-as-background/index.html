    <h1>The three.js scene is an HTML Canvas element and you can position it on the page as a background or overlay!
      There is CSS for both in this file. Note you cannot use the orbit controls to spin the scene around with your
      mouse if it is in the background. You can use orbit controls with an overlay, though you won't be able to interact
      with the HTML underneath unless the controls are disabled. </h1>

    <h1>Note that you can still scroll down the page and the background stays in the same place. This is because its
      position is
      set to fixed.</h1>
